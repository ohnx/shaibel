Chess engine made following the excellent [Chess Engine In C tutorial by Bluefever Software](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ1QII7yudbc-Ky058TEaOstZHVbT-2hg).

Currently probably pretty bad, as I'm only halfway through the series. It works enough to play on Lichess, though!

Play against it [here](https://lichess.org/@/shaibel123).
Currently accepts Standard variant bullet, blitz, rapid, and classical.
